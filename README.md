# React-Geo-Weather
A simple, interactive weather app using React, Leaflet, and OpenWeatherMap.

For a more complete weather app check out https://geo-weather.xyz/

This is a bare bones version that is meant to be an example of how to use React-Leaflet and OpenWeather to build a weather app. It is the same skeleton that geo-weather.xyz is built on and a great starting off point for any react weather app.  

The map portion provided by Leaflet => https://react-leaflet.js.org/  
The weather API from OpenWeatherMap API => https://openweathermap.org/  

Clone repo, enter your API_KEY, and run npm start. Click anywhere on the map to get basic weather data for that location. Example...
