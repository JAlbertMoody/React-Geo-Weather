# React-Geo-Weather
React-Geo-Weather is a simple, interactive weather app built using React, Leaflet, and OpenWeatherMap. It allows users to click anywhere on the map and get basic weather data for that location.

This app is a bare-bones version that serves as an example of how to use React-Leaflet and OpenWeatherMap to build a weather app. It's the same skeleton that powers geo-weather.xyz and is a great starting point for any React weather app.
